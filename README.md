🎮 A collection of 5 classic games built with pure Java Swing: Snake, Ping Pong, Blackjack, Pac-Man, and Flappy Bird. No dependencies, no setup—just fork, run, and play. Perfect for learning GUI, game loops, and event-driven programming in Java.
# 🎮 Java Arcade: A Pure Java Swing Game Collection

Welcome to **Java Arcade** – a hand-crafted collection of classic arcade games built entirely with **Java Swing and AWT**. Whether you're a beginner Java developer, a student learning GUI programming, or a nostalgic gamer looking to relive the classics, this project is for you.

This is **fork-and-run** code – no external libraries, no complex setup. Just download and play!

## 🧩 What’s Included?

This bundle contains **5 fully functional, retro-inspired games**, written from scratch in Java:

| Game          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🐍 **Snake**   | Eat to grow, dodge your tail, and survive the grid. |
| 🏓 **Ping Pong** | Classic two-player (or single vs AI) paddle game. Fast reflexes required! |
| 🃏 **Blackjack** | Simple card game vs the dealer. Try to hit 21 without busting. |
| 👻 **Pac-Man** | Navigate the maze, eat pellets, avoid ghosts. Classic arcade fun. |
| 🐦 **Flappy Bird** | Tap to fly and survive the pipes in this infamously addictive game. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

> 💡 This is as plug-and-play as it gets. Just follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-arcade.git
   cd java-arcade
2. **Open in your IDE**
(IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, or any Java-supporting IDE)
3.**Run the Launcher**
  Simply run:
    GameLauncher.java


 **🔧 How It Works**
At the core of the project is the GameLauncher.java file. It's a simple Swing-based menu that allows you to launch each game individually.

Under the Hood:
🎨 GUI: Built entirely with Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, etc.)

🎮 Controls: All games use KeyListener or MouseListener for smooth player input.

⏱️ Game Loops: Controlled using javax.swing.Timer for animation and physics.

🖼️ Rendering: Custom rendering is handled via paintComponent(Graphics g) in each game panel.

🔗 Modularity: Each game is encapsulated in its own class, making them independent and maintainable.

**💡 Why This Project?**
This project started as a personal challenge to revisit core Java concepts and build something fun along the way. It’s designed to:

Teach game loop mechanics

Demonstrate basic GUI architecture

Provide a fully working playground for Java learners

**✅ Pros & ❌ Cons**
✅ Pros:
No Dependencies: 100% Java SE. Just compile and run.

Educational: Great for understanding Swing, AWT, timers, and input handling.

Beginner-Friendly: Simple structure, well-commented code.

Extensible: Easily add your own games or enhance existing ones.

Cross-platform: Runs anywhere Java does – Windows, macOS, Linux.

❌ Cons:
Legacy UI Tech: Uses Swing, which is dated. (Still excellent for learning.)

Basic Graphics: Don’t expect AAA visuals.

Performance Limits: Minor flickering or delay may occur due to Swing’s limitations.

Hardcoded Logic: No advanced architecture or abstraction – simple and straightforward.
